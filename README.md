# Bernstein Vazirani Algorithm

The Bernstein Vazirani Algorithm is one of many quatum algorithms that helps demostrate quantum supremacy. Although not particularly useful, it's an important proof of concept.

The goal of the BV Algorithm is to find a secret bitstring (stored in a "black box"). A traditional classical algorithm would have to query the blackbox as many times there are bits to find the secret bitstring. Eg. if the secret number is 1001, it would have to make 4 querys. This algorithm would only have to query the blackbox once, no matter how large the bitstring.
